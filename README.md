# A Golang API for Cybersecurity Job Opportunities üõ°Ô∏èüíº

This project is a modern Job Opportunity API for CyberSecurity (or others) built using Golang. The API is developed by Go-Gin as the router, GoORM for database communication, SQLite (for now) as the database, and Swagger for documentation and API testing. The project follows a modern package structure to keep the code base organized and maintainable.

## Features üåü

- Introduction to Golang and building modern APIs
- Setting up the development environment for creating the API
- Using Go-Gin as a router for route management
- Implementing SQLite (for now) as database API
- Use of GoORM to communicate with the database
- Swagger integration for API documentation and testing
- Creation of a modern package structure for project organization
- Implementation of a complete job opportunities API with endpoints for searching, creating, editing and deleting opportunities (CRUD)
  
## Installation üöö

To use this project, you need to follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `go mod download`
3. Build the application: `go build`
4. Run the application: `./main`

## Makefile Commands üõ†Ô∏è

The project includes a Makefile to help you manage common tasks more easily. Here's a list of the available commands and a brief description of what they do:

- `make run`: Run the application without generating API documentation.
- `make run-with-docs`: Generate the API documentation using Swag, then run the application.
- `make build`: Build the application and create an executable file named `secjobs`.
- `make docs`: Generate the API documentation using Swag.
- `make clean`: Remove the `secjobs` executable and delete the `./docs` directory.

To use these commands, simply type `make` followed by the desired command in your terminal. For example:

```sh
make run
```

## Docker and Docker Compose üê≥

This project includes a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` file for easy containerization and deployment. Here are the most common Docker and Docker Compose commands you may want to use:

- `docker build -t your-image-name .`: Build a Docker image for the project. Replace `your-image-name` with a name for your image.
- `docker run -p 8080:8080 -e PORT=8080 your-image-name`: Run a container based on the built image. Replace `your-image-name` with the name you used when building the image. You can change the port number if necessary.

If you want to use Docker Compose, follow these commands:

- `docker compose build`: Build the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
- `docker compose up`: Run the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

To stop and remove containers, networks, and volumes defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file, run:

```sh
docker-compose down
```

For more information on Docker and Docker Compose, refer to the official documentation:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Used Tools üìùüõ†Ô∏è

This project uses the following tools:

- [Golang](https://golang.org/) for backend development
- [Go-Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) for route management
- [GoORM](https://gorm.io/) for database communication
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) as the database
- [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) for API documentation and testing

## Usage üìù

After the API is running, you can use the Swagger UI to interact with the endpoints for searching, creating, editing, and deleting job opportunities. The API can be accessed at `http://localhost:$PORT/swagger/index.html`.

Default $PORT if not provided=8080.
